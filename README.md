# weather-app

This is a project where we are making a computer program that will show you the weather. It will use information from different places on the internet to show you what the weather is like right now. It will also constantly update the information so you always have the most up-to-date weather. 
We changed two computer files to get information about the weather from a website and let people share things on our own website. We did this by using a special code that helps the different parts of the website talk to each other. The index.html helps us find things on a website and the style.css helps make it look pretty. 
When you click on something, the screen shows you the date, how hot it is, and what people have said. The screen changes and updates all by itself!
